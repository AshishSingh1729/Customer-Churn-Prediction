End to end Classification project to predict Customers who are likely to Churn

Explored telecom dataset , did EDA and Feature engineering on it.
Engineered a Random Forest Classifier model for a highly imbalanced telecom dataset, achieving over 80% accuracy and recall using SMOTEENN oversampling 
and hypertuning parameters using Gridsearch.
Further deployed the model on the web with Python Flask to improve customer retention by predicting the probability of churn for a customer.
